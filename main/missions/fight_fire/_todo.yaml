todo:
    - generate results with larger sample sizes, maybe analyze slices of them if anything seems suspicious
    - make the corridor longer and measure regular vs genetic performance:
        - generate worlds and offline samples on-demand
        - add a length variable
        - make the printing toggle-able

done:
    - test it on the randomly collected samples
    - graph of genetic performance
    - graph of regular performance
    - evaluate with no memory
